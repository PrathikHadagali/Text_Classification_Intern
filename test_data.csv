"Hi,
On invitation, I visited the Caratlane store in Burdwan, 713103 and
'unfortunately' purchased an ear ring of 20,818/-.
My registered email ID for CaratLane: ppritamghosh2@gmail.com

They provided a BharatPe QR code to pay using which I paid by IDBI bank GO+
account.
I showed the reference ID also the message received from IDBI (attached).

However, surprisingly the store refused to hand over the item. Mr Sirsendu
Chakraborty, the store manager didn't support us at all. Mr. Mohammed Rakeb
from Caratlane called Mr Chakraborty and confused him more saying its the
weekend so don't hand over the item. Mr. Chakraborty said it's the problem
with the QR code *(**BharatPe**,* *please have a look please, is this a
correct claim?)*!

I was in front of Mr Chakrabarty during his conversation with Mr Rakeb.
I told Mr. Chakraborty that I want to talk with Mr Rakeb. However, Mr.
Rakeb denied it at first, but later upon request of Mr Chakraborty, he
agreed to talk with me.
Mr. Rakeb suggested transferring funds again!! The successful transfer will
be considered and the rest will be refunded!!!

I am really surprised with the behaviour of Mr Chakrabarty and especially
Mr Rakeb for his hypothetical suggestion.

I want CaratLane to hand over my item and this will be the last time for
any procurement from CaratLane. Caratlane also misbehaved with my friend Ms
Shaswati Mandal living in Israel who ordered items for her parents living
in chakdaha, Nadia.

Overall, its not only me facing misbehaviour from caratlane. I am surprised
and strongly condemn the misbehaviour of customer handling by caratlane.

Sincerely,
Dr. Pritam Ghosh

"Hi,

I had placed a PO order for a ring from your Panaji(Goa) store vide order
reference no. 398 dated 01/12/2022 and also made an advance payment for the
same.

But unfortunately, I want to cancel the existing order and place another
order for a ring with a new design as the ring ordered by me has lord
Ganesha as part of its design and such rings with the image of God are not
allowed to be worn in our culture and hence it wont be useful to me as I
want to buy a ring which can be worn by me on a daily basis

Kindly assist me by allowing to cancel the existing order as soon as
possible so that I can place a new order and get what I want which is of
use to me.

I am attaching the scanned copy of the bill for your kind perusal.
