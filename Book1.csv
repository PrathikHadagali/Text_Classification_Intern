TKT-0008856632,Jewellery,Non Service,Closed,Caratlane,Query,Boutique Service Related[Q],Tanishq_store Details,As per the confirmation from the caratlane team we are closing the case,"Hi,
On invitation, I visited the Caratlane store in Burdwan, 713103 and
'unfortunately' purchased an ear ring of 20,818/-.
My registered email ID for CaratLane: ppritamghosh2@gmail.com

They provided a BharatPe QR code to pay using which I paid by IDBI bank GO+
account.
I showed the reference ID also the message received from IDBI (attached).

However, surprisingly the store refused to hand over the item. Mr Sirsendu
Chakraborty, the store manager didn't support us at all. Mr. Mohammed Rakeb
from Caratlane called Mr Chakraborty and confused him more saying its the
weekend so don't hand over the item. Mr. Chakraborty said it's the problem
with the QR code *(**BharatPe**,* *please have a look please, is this a
correct claim?)*!

I was in front of Mr Chakrabarty during his conversation with Mr Rakeb.
I told Mr. Chakraborty that I want to talk with Mr Rakeb. However, Mr.
Rakeb denied it at first, but later upon request of Mr Chakraborty, he
agreed to talk with me.
Mr. Rakeb suggested transferring funds again!! The successful transfer will
be considered and the rest will be refunded!!!

I am really surprised with the behaviour of Mr Chakrabarty and especially
Mr Rakeb for his hypothetical suggestion.

I want CaratLane to hand over my item and this will be the last time for
any procurement from CaratLane. Caratlane also misbehaved with my friend Ms
Shaswati Mandal living in Israel who ordered items for her parents living
in chakdaha, Nadia.

Overall, its not only me facing misbehaviour from caratlane. I am surprised
and strongly condemn the misbehaviour of customer handling by caratlane.
